🧠 BERT-Based Sentiment Analysis Model

BERT-Based Sentiment Analysis is an advanced NLP project that classifies text sentiment using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. This tool leverages deep learning and transformer-based architectures to understand contextual meanings in text, achieving high accuracy in sentiment prediction.

📋 Project Overview

The Sentiment Analysis Model helps analyze and determine whether a given text expresses positive, neutral, or negative emotions.
It’s built using PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers, demonstrating practical implementation of fine-tuning large language models for real-world text classification.

Key objectives:

Automate opinion and feedback analysis for products, services, or content.

Build an accurate sentiment predictor using pretrained transformer models.

Explore fine-tuning techniques for BERT and evaluation metrics for NLP models.

🔑 Features
1️⃣ Text Preprocessing

Cleans and tokenizes input text.

Removes unwanted symbols, URLs, and stopwords.

Converts text to numerical embeddings using BERT Tokenizer.

2️⃣ Model Training and Evaluation

Fine-tunes BERT-base-uncased on labeled sentiment datasets.

Implements gradient clipping, learning rate scheduling, and mini-batch training for efficiency.

Evaluates performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

3️⃣ Sentiment Prediction

Predicts sentiment for new text samples in real-time.

Outputs easy-to-interpret results with confidence scores.

📊 How It Works
Data Preparation

Load and preprocess dataset (CSV with text and sentiment columns).

Split data into training, validation, and test sets.

Model Training

Fine-tune pretrained BERT on the dataset.

Use GPU acceleration for faster convergence.

Prediction

Input a new sentence → Model predicts sentiment → Outputs label (Positive / Neutral / Negative).

Example:

Text: "I absolutely love this product!"
Predicted Sentiment: Positive

🧪 Results

Achieved ~90% accuracy on validation dataset.

Demonstrated strong generalization on unseen text samples.
